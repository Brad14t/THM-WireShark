# THM-WireShark & Nmap

This will be my process with the Try Hack Me `WireShark: The Basics, WireShark: Packet Operations, and WireShark: Traffic Analysis`


**1. Read the "capture file comments". What is the flag?**

First I go to the `statistics` tab in the top, scroll down to the comments and find the flag.

**2. What is the total number of packets?**

In the same tab as the last question, the answer is provided under the `statistics details`

<img width="694" height="205" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-26 105859" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ac930b8-5d97-4dc1-a18e-7d556bbfa0d1" />

**3. What is the SHA256 hash value of the capture file?**

Scrolling up in that same details tab, it shows the SHA256 hash

I used the `ip` command and saw the number of displayed packets.

<img width="899" height="729" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 085005" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b742578-6661-40f5-a509-802fa2ec8e88" />

**25. What is the number of packets with a "TTL value less than 10"?**

I used `ip.ttl < 10`

<img width="810" height="726" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 085205" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/012c655c-99ab-4d1f-a470-2fd49984893c" />

**28. What is the number of "type A DNS Queries"?**

First I start by trying to find a query, I select the analyse tab then Display filter expression.

<img width="346" height="148" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 090551" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a3541f0-f340-459d-9d93-e0b6ef616a44" />

I searched dns, and scrolled through till I found `dns.qry.type` and this allows me to select only type a.

<img width="825" height="846" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 090643" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bba545d-288b-4194-8848-f1ab0d64a888" />

This wont give the correct answer, I am needing responses only. So I go back and make another query, by searching dns and scrolling through the options.

I found the one I beleive is correct, it is `dns.flag.response`

<img width="823" height="831" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 091159" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04433b3d-5dac-4ca3-8cef-abd1b9c91fc3" />

Add both together to a full query of `dns.qry.type ==1 && dns.flag.response == 1`

<img width="1505" height="779" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 091419" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9588386-1cee-4b4a-b3e1-d499b18c40ff" />

**29. Find all Microsoft IIS servers. What is the number of packets that did not originate from "port 80"?**

First I want to find all packets with Microsoft

`http.server contains "Microsoft"`, now that I have all the packets with the Microsoft server, I need a query to find the packets that dont originate from port 80.

full command I used `http.server contains "Microsoft" && tcp.srcport != 80`

<img width="1516" height="768" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 094432" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/174d83e8-c0d2-4247-9510-19c8f946a540" />

**30. Find all Microsoft IIS servers. What is the number of packets that have "version 7.5"?**

After looking at the packets and testing queries I landed on this one.

`http.server contains "Microsoft" && http.server matches "7.5"`

<img width="1517" height="780" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 095349" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfde55bc-0428-4a1f-9370-ef545fad8123" />

**31. What is the total number of packets that use ports 3333, 4444 or 9999?**

`tcp.port in {3333 4444 9999}`

<img width="1512" height="780" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 095650" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb90370e-10dd-4251-bc6e-d887ae77cb44" />

**32. What is the number of packets with "even TTL numbers"?**

First thing is to translate the packets into strings, this can be done by `string(ip.ttl)`

Then I want the packets to match only even numbers by adding `matches "[02468]$"` this matches only the regex numbers of even numbers, the $ is the anchor saying it needs to end in that even number range.

<img width="1495" height="784" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 100511" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70262306-4749-48ed-bb42-559b57b0d4c0" />

**33. Change the profile to "Checksum Control". What is the number of "Bad TCP Checksum" packets?**

First I select edit, then configuration profiles, then select checksum control.

<img width="366" height="802" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 100715" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6d305c1-ff63-42dd-b533-3659a0827e3c" />

Then I craft a query by looking up `dns.checksum`

<img width="819" height="782" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 100939" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78bb2ec1-175b-4e89-b3e8-8f0b6e4212df" />

<img width="1381" height="778" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 101035" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce7d4a63-e830-4a63-ab36-45c5f5f971c5" />

**34. Use the existing filtering button to filter the traffic. What is the number of displayed packets?**

Using the same profile config, use the existing filter gives me the answer.

<img width="963" height="394" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 101211" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47647a99-1f59-4a14-b28f-c06554594c1e" />

# NMAP Notes & Exersises 

**Most common nmap scans:** `TCP connect scans, SYN scans, UDP scans`

**Below are the base filters to probe Nmap scan behaviour on the network:**

Global search - `tcp` `udp`

**TCP Flags**

`tcp.flags == 2` - will only match packets where only the SYN flag is set and no other flags are set. This is typical of the initial SYN packet sent by a client to establish a connection. (SYN flag is the ONLY flag)

`tcp.flags.syn == 1` -  will match any packet where the SYN flag is set, regardless of the state of other flags (e.g., it would match a SYN-ACK packet where both SYN and ACK flags are set).

`tcp.flags == 16` - ACK flag is the only flag

`tcp.flags.ack == 1` - will match any packet with the ACK flag set.

`tcp.flags == 18` - Filters for packets that contain SYN and ACK flags.

`(tcp.flags.syn == 1) and (tcp.flags.ack == 1)` - Second step of the 3 way handshake, filters for packets with ONLY SYN and ACK flags.

`tcp.flags.reset == 1` - Any TCP packet where the RST flag is set to 1. This can include packets with other flags set, such as a RST-ACK packet.

`tcp.flags == 4` - Only TCP packets where only the RST flag is set and all other flags are 0.

`tcp.flags == 20` - Only packets with just the RST and ACK flags set

`(tcp.flags.reset == 1) and (tcp.flags.ack == 1)` - All packets with both the RST and ACK flags set

`tcp.flags.fin == 1` - All packets with the FIN flag set (e.g., FIN and FIN-ACK)

`tcp.flags == 1` - Only packets with just the FIN flag set

**TCP Connect Scan**

Command to test connection and see if port is open `nmap -sT`

`Open TCP Port`(standard tcp handshake) - SYN --> <-- SYN, ACK ACK -->

`Open TCP Port with reset` - SYN --> <-- SYN, ACK ACK --> RST, ACK --> the RST ACK tear down the connection. The RST is a "panic button" that tells the server to immediately close and discard any connection state

`Closed TCP Port` - SYN --> <-- RST, ACK

analysts need to use a generic filter to view the initial anomaly patterns, and then it will be easier to focus on a specific traffic point. The given filter shows the TCP Connect scan patterns in a capture file. - `tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0 and tcp.window_size > 1024`

**SYN Scans**

These dont rely on the 3 way handshake

Usually conducted using `nmap -sS` - this is a stealthier scan than `nmap -sT` it is also quicker and less intrusive.

The handshake is ended before the final ACK packet, this way its stealthier.

`Open TCP Port using -sS` - SYN --> <-- SYN,ACK RST-->

`Close TCP Port using -sS` - SYN --> <-- RST,ACK

The given filter shows the TCP SYN scan patterns in a capture file. - `tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0 and tcp.window_size <= 1024`

**UDP Scan**

ICMP error message for close ports

Doesn't require a handshake process

`Open UDP port` - UDP packet -->

`Closed UDP Port` - UDP packet --> ICMP Type 3, Code 3 message. (Destination unreachable, port unreachable)

The given filter shows the UDP scan patterns in a capture file. - `icmp.type==3 and icmp.code==3`

**35. What is the total number of the "TCP Connect" scans?**

I ran the command I saved for finding all TCP connect scans. `tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0 and tcp.window_size > 1024`

**36. Which scan type is used to scan the TCP port 80?**

First I will start by running `tcp.port == 80`

Then once narrowed down I look at the info provided and I can see the normal open port handshake for TCP Connect.

<img width="291" height="98" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 122257" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc35ed70-b79c-459b-abda-a74c0a21dc77" />

**37. How many "UDP close port" messages are there?**

I ran the search I saved for UDP closed ports - `icmp.type==3 and icmp.code==3`

<img width="845" height="730" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 122621" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/185e03ad-47d0-43b9-91ca-3be063f1a29b" />

**38. Which UDP port in the 55-70 port range is open?**

To start I need to find the udp ports in that range, I can do that with this command `udp.port in {55..70}` this searches the udp ports, in the port range described.

<img width="610" height="452" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 123006" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1b65658-264d-42fc-b790-8e6ebd3b78bb" />

After submitting that query, I can see the ports to the right.

**ARP Poisoning/Spoofing (A.K.A. Man In The Middle Attack)**

ARP protocol, or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), is the technology responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network. Address Resolution Protocol Poisoning (also known as ARP Spoofing or Man In The Middle (MITM) attack) is a type of attack that involves network jamming/manipulating by sending malicious ARP packets to the default gateway. The ultimate aim is to manipulate the "IP to MAC address table" and sniff the traffic of the target host.

`arp.opcode == 1` - displays all ARP request packets in a captured network trace.

`arp.opcode == 2` - all ARP replies

`arp.dst.hw_mac==00:00:00:00:00:00` - All ARP requests for that MAC 

`arp.duplicate-address-detected or arp.duplicate-address-frame` - This filter flags the initial ARP packet that Wireshark identifies as being part of a duplicate address conflict. Then All subsequent ARP packets that are part of the duplicate IP address conflict.

`((arp) && (arp.opcode == 1)) && (arp.src.hw_mac == target-mac-address)` - find all ARP request packets originating from a specific MAC address.

**39. What is the number of ARP requests crafted by the attacker?**

First command I do is `arp.opcode == 1` to get all ARP request, then I can see that there are a lot of requests to the same address. So I expand the details and note they all have the same MAC. Copy that MAC I will need it later.

Then I run this command to get all request by that MAC. `eth.src == 00:0c:29:e2:18:b4 && arp.opcode ==1`

<img width="861" height="734" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 150529" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4301810e-335b-4cf5-b939-0d2b982b7385" />

**40. What is the number of HTTP packets received by the attacker?**

`eth.dst == 00:0c:29:e2:18:b4 && http`

<img width="788" height="720" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 151523" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebccb9b6-678e-433e-b90e-a1d2967c040f" />

**41. What is the number of sniffed username&password entries?**

First I want to only see http where data was submitted with a POST. `http.request.method == POST` Then I expanded them and noticed the Hosts were the same.

<img width="340" height="87" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 152612" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79969c9d-8fb5-4dd8-8112-6c91c9e11186" />

I can go through the 10 values and see which ones have usr and psw.

**42. What is the password of the "Client986"**

Since I saw in the last question that the data was captured in the URL Encoder, so I will piggy back off that.

`urlencoded-form matches "client986"`

<img width="500" height="168" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 153859" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d8e0e47-1324-43a3-87b6-f25e617649a9" />

**43. What is the comment provided by the "Client354"?**

Same command as last time, just change the client. `unlencoded-form matches "client354"`

<img width="532" height="146" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 154104" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d07b2f9b-8258-4ee7-a0f0-169a2f2f7125" />

**44. What is the MAC address of the host "Galaxy A30"?**

First command I tried was `dhcp.option.hostname contains "Galaxy A30"` but nothing came up, I changed my command to be less exact `dhcp.option.hostname contains "A30"`

That second command was succesful

<img width="845" height="715" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 120138" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/279483ba-65ff-468a-ac88-69f7590baaa3" />

**45. How many NetBIOS registration requests does the "LIVALJM" workstation have?**

First I need to craft a search for NBNS registration request filter.

<img width="1265" height="798" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 124337" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/186bcbb6-0b0a-4620-b04b-7bb3395bdf38" />

Then I need it to match the name given.

<img width="1262" height="831" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 124432" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d24c3607-d29f-4e84-bbb3-42b53cf80102" />

Then I can see the total at the bottom.

<img width="1629" height="789" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 124541" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0385310-b8bf-43a5-ab3c-b6849a901cf0" />

**46. Which host requested the IP address "172.16.13.85"?**

First I need just the request flags so I will start with `dhcp.option.dhcp == 3`

Then I go through the filters to find `dhcp.option.request_ip_address == 172.16.13.85`

Final full command I used was `dhcp.option.dhcp == 3 && dhcp.option.request_ip_address == 172.16.13.85`

Then double clicking info to expand to the host.

<img width="1243" height="838" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 124857" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b09bc54b-776c-4f5b-b0c4-6dac748ae353" />

**47. What is the IP address of the user "u5"? (Enter the address in defanged format.)**

First command I used was `kerberos.CNameString contains "u5"` then I double clicked the firsat result and looking into the kerberos details. Found the u5 user and the address associated.

<img width="889" height="390" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 125515" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c4445a5-8ae8-45c4-bdc2-6e565ae69004" />

**48. What is the hostname of the available host in the Kerberos packets?** 

I can find this info on the same packet. Just needing to add $ to the end since that indicates hostnames.

<img width="515" height="129" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 130038" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eff4d67-4f9f-49eb-b540-a30b4268c50d" />

**49. Investigate the anomalous packets. Which protocol is used in ICMP tunnelling?**

The answer to this is one of many protocols used during ICMP tunnelling. I guessed `SSH` since its a popular option.

**50. Investigate the anomalous packets. What is the suspicious main domain address that receives anomalous DNS queries? (Enter the address in defanged format.)**

First I want to look at lond DNS records so I used this command `dns.qry.name.len > 50 and !mdns` I am searching for dns queries that are long entries, which is malicous. Then the !mdns is the multicast local, I am wanting all data other than the local info.

This provided with to many entiries, I need filter more so since I a looking for a domain I can search for anything with ".com"

My full query is `dns.qry.name.len > 50 and !mdns and dns.qry.name contains .com`

Then clicking on one of the entries, you can see the domain to the side.

**51. How many incorrect login attempts are there?**

To get all failed login attempts I need response code of 430 & 530.

`ftp.response.code == 430 and ftp.response.code == 530`

<img width="865" height="713" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 141149" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/337ee6ec-e385-4fbc-9037-e58df99e609d" />

**52. What is the size of the file accessed by the "ftp" account?**

This is a user requesting access from the ftp account. So for the command I can use `ftp.request.arg == "ftp"`

Now I have 2 packets, 1 as a PASS and the other is USER ftp, next I will follow the stream of the USER packet.

<img width="773" height="159" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 141933" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eabd57b-7960-4490-823d-9bfba734dbdd" />

Scrolling through the TCP stream I can find the answer.

<img width="229" height="98" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 142033" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3199362-a2ed-450c-ba55-3944660be2eb" />

**53. The adversary uploaded a document to the FTP server. What is the filename?**

Answer is provided in the same place as last question.

**54. The adversary tried to assign special flags to change the executing permissions of the uploaded file. What is the command used by the adversary?**

To find this answer I sorted the packets by latest, then right before the QUIT packet I inspected it and saw they used chmod 777.

<img width="759" height="392" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 142828" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72ed24fe-004c-4a2b-a4d5-9fd637860b36" />

**55. Investigate the user agents. What is the number of anomalous  "user-agent" types?**

First the command I used to see user agents is `http.user_agent` then I added user agent as a column.

<img width="1062" height="735" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 144144" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc3e7076-329f-42e8-b447-a5f7b39ac979" />

Then I went through the user agent fields and found 6 different entries.

**56. What is the packet number with a subtle spelling difference in the user agent field?**

For this I just looked at the entries or user agent.

<img width="167" height="93" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 145026" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b722eae1-2974-4b36-a016-58e02d9c40b6" />

**57. Locate the "Log4j" attack starting phase. What is the packet number?**

Command I used was `(http.user_agent contains "$") or (http.user_agent contains "==")`

Then I copied the User agent value and decoded from Base 64.

<img width="1448" height="689" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 150309" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b33cd987-1401-44e1-b7e6-5b4920818564" />

I can see after it is decoded I can see the wget to get the file lh.sh from the provided IP.

**58. Locate the "Log4j" attack starting phase and decode the base64 command. What is the IP address contacted by the adversary? (Enter the address in defanged format and exclude "{}".)**

Answer provided in the last answer.

**59. What is the frame number of the "Client Hello" message sent to "accounts.google.com"?**

First thing I did was use the command `(http.request or tls.handshake.type == 1) and !(ssdp)` to get all client hello messages. Then clicked on the first entry and found the server name, then selected that as a filter and added "accounts.google.com" and found the answer. Final command with filter is `tls.handshake.extensions_server_name == "accounts.google.com"`

<img width="826" height="700" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-03 113811" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ec48406-7cbe-426c-a5bf-7cac5ea27259" />

**60. Decrypt the traffic with the "KeysLogFile.txt" file. What is the number of HTTP2 packets?**

First I add the key log file `Edit > Preferences > Protocols > TLS`

<img width="1051" height="691" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-03 114252" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df27eb9b-31b3-47a5-bd9b-c3c7a71343ff" />

**61. Go to Frame 322. What is the authority header of the HTTP2 packet? (Enter the address in defanged format.)**

First I go to packet 322, then scroll down to the authority header.

<img width="698" height="70" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-03 114541" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16effc80-230c-449b-8f15-fbe501417a53" />

Then I go to `File > Export Objects > HTTP` I see 2 packets, I will go to the first.

<img width="752" height="724" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-03 114735" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2f9f31d-6f17-496c-b26d-eb86491dc789" />

**62. What is the packet number of the credentials using "HTTP Basic Auth"?**

First I go to `Tools > Credentials`

Then I see the answer at the bottom.

<img width="848" height="472" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-03 130306" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f65e888-84df-492c-af5a-555f24bf78e7" />

**63. What is the packet number where "empty password" was submitted?**

First I started by filtering for only PASS packets with this command `ftp.request.command == "PASS"`

Then going through each packet I look for an empty passwork field. Below I will show one with a password and the answer with no password.

<img width="502" height="478" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-03 130740" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35e3af13-99bc-4fcf-82e2-dddaa836e960" />
